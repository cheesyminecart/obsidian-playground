# obsidian-playground
The app obsidian has been a life-changer for me. Ever since I downloaded it, I've been feeling much, much more productive than I would have previously - in part thanks to its ability to create an environment that resonates with the user. 

As a result, I'm taking it upon myself to learn TypeScript - a continuation for my web development journey!
